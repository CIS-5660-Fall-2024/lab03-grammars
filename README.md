# lab03-grammars
Let's practice using grammars! For this lab, please pull up the L-system node in Houdini.

## 1. Wheat grammar puzzle
Look at these iterations (n = 1, 2, 3) of a one-rule grammar. Using the built in symbols in Houdini, design a grammar that produces this output. Take a screenshot of your rules.\

## 2. Square grammar puzzle
How about this one? Take a screenshot of your rules.\

This is a tree that (kind of) looks like a skull. The Axiom is FXA, where  A is only ever used once to add the top portion of the skull. The F and X are types of branches, where F is a regular banch with a transition and X is a special layer that calls itself once every iteration, along with D and F. D is a 'delay' that stands in for F, so it is replaced with F in the next iteration. This is used to reduce clutter of the branches. Here are a few iterations:
