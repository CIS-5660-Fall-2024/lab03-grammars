# lab03-grammars
Let's practice using grammars! For this lab, please pull up the L-system node in Houdini.

## 1. Wheat grammar puzzle
Look at these iterations (n = 1, 2, 3) of a one-rule grammar. Using the built in symbols in Houdini, design a grammar that produces this output. Take a screenshot of your rules.\

## 2. Square grammar puzzle
How about this one? Take a screenshot of your rules.\

## 3. Custom plant
Choose a plant in the world. Working off a reference, design a grammar that mimics the structure of that plant. Unlike our simple puzzles, please use multiple rules for greater complexity. Think carefully about the structure of your grammar! EXPLAIN the structure of your plant in the README. What are the components? What do each of the rules do? Be sure to also include images of a few iterations of your output plant. 

I wanted to make at baobab tree:

I wanted to emulate the tall, straight trunk with the dense branches that spread out horizontally at the top. The first rule extends the main "trunk" and creates a branch on the right and the left, and the second rule creates smaller sub-branches to increase the foliage density. The third rule just extends the length of each segment more, which is what I used to make the tree trunk longer.
